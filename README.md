## Motivation and Objectives

In every varsity sports team, there are several admininistrative matters to deal with to such as attendance of team members, allocating of equipment, etc. most of these are done manually with spread sheets which does not scale very well, timeconsuming and troublesome. 

Hence, to reduce the workload of the exco on these administrative matters and in turn allow the exco to focus more on leading the team during trainings it will be a good idea to create a solution that:

1. Updates the attendance of the team on a daily automatically.

2. Blasts daily boat allocations in the team chat.

Telegarm is one of the common messaging applications among people currently, it supports both mobile devices and desktop making as well as across multiple platforms. One of the features of Telegram is the use of Telegram Bots which allows developers to developed bots for various purposes. Hence this project leverages on telegram's Bot API to devise a solution for the Team's needs.
